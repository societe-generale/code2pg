[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
    code2pg will estimate in man-days how difficult a migration from Oracle to
    PostgreSQL would be regarding application code. It does not handle the
    database code as ora2pg does, only the given application code. Therefore,
    a directory of source code (either files or svn) should be given as input
    and code2pg will generate a report in one of the following format:
    minimal, text or html.

    The program can generate a csv output file, alerting the user on which
    files (and which lines) were Oracle instructions encountered. It can also
    directly tag the source code with special comments in order to navigate
    quickly to those instructions.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
    [1m-c[0m , [1m--config-file[0m string
        This configuration file will contain all user configurable switches.
        An example file is given (code2pg.conf). If a parameter is present in
        both config file and command line, the command line will take
        precedence. If no configuration file is given, at least the extension
        and language parameters are needed.

    [1m-C[0m , [1m--csv-output[0m string
        Oracle keywords will be redirected to this csv file. This file could
        be used to monitor the progress of the migration while working on the
        translation.

    [1m-d[0m, [1m--directory[0m string
        Specify which directory should be recursively analyzed. Defaults to
        current directory.

        Can be used multiple times, for eg: ./code2pg -d dir1 -d dir2 ...

    [1m-D[0m, [1m--directorytype[0m string
        Specify which type of directory will be analyzed. It could be a normal
        directory within the filesystem or a remote svn access. Type =
        [file|svn]. Defaults to file.

    [1m-e[0m, [1m--extension[0m string
        Which file extensions will be analyzed in the specified directory. No
        preceding dot should be used. This should be set together with
        [4mlanguage[0m when no configuration file is provided.

        Can be used multiple times, for eg: ./code2pg -e ext1 -e ext2 ...

    [1m-f[0m , [1m--format[0m string
        The report will be generated according to the specified format. It
        could be one of these values: txt, html or minimal. Defaults to html.

    [1m-h[0m , [1m--help[0m [string]
        Prints a short help.

        With a parameter, prints help on the specified RDBMS instruction in a
        markdown format, such as links to official documentation, comments,
        difficulty ... If this parameter is [4mall_instructions[0m, then all
        available instructions will be sent to standard output.

    [1m-l[0m , [1m--language[0m string
        The chosen language calling the RDBMS. This should be set together
        with [4mextension[0m when no configuration file is provided. lang =
        [java|proc|cobol|javascript|dotnet|plsql|...]

    [1m--level1-minutes [0m integer
        Number of minutes needed to translate a level1 instruction (1 by
        default).

    [1m--level2-minutes [0m integer
        Number of minutes needed to translate a level2 instruction (4 by
        default).

    [1m--level3-minutes [0m integer
        Number of minutes needed to translate a level3 instruction (8 by
        default).

    [1m--level4-minutes [0m integer
        Number of minutes needed to translate a level4 instruction (16 by
        default).

    [1m--minutes-per-workday [0m integer
        Number of minutes per workday (360 by default).

    [1m-o[0m , [1m--output-file[0m string
        The name (without the directory) of the generated report. A good
        practice would be to use a proper extension depending on the type of
        report.

    [1m-O[0m , [1m--output-directory[0m string
        Specifies in which directory the report will be saved.

    [1m--rdbms[0m string
        Migration will be from the specified RDBMS to PostgreSQL. So far, only
        Oracle is supported.

        rdbms = [oracle]

    [1m-r[0m , [1m--orafce[0m
        Specifies if the migration will be using orafce. If so, many Oracle
        instructions won't need to be translated and migrations will be eased.

    [1m-p[0m , [1m--password[0m
        If the directory type is SVN, this will provide the password for the
        required svn commands. Both password and username parameters must be
        provided at the same time. If you do not wish to use this option on
        the command line, you could save your svn credentials locally. The
        file ~/.subversion/servers should be changed with store-passwords=yes
        and store-plaintext-passwords=yes.

    [1m-q[0m, [1m--quiet[0m
        Do not output to stdout. This will silence notifications such as the
        progress report.

    [1m-t[0m , [1m--tagfiles[0m
        Every time an Oracle instruction is encountered, the corresponding
        file and line could be tagged in order to alert the developper. This
        comment will be like CODE2PG_Instruction, which should allow easy
        searching. As for now, only a local directory is supported (no svn).

        Important: use on a copy of your files.

    [1m-u[0m , [1m--username[0m
        If the directory type is SVN, this will provide the username for the
        required svn commands. Both password and username parameters must be
        provided at the same time. If you do not wish to use this option on
        the command line, you could save your svn credentials locally. The
        file ~/.subversion/servers should be changed with store-passwords=yes
        and store-plaintext-passwords=yes.

    [1m-v[0m, [1m--version[0m
        Print the version of the program and exit.

[1mBUGS AND LIMITATIONS[0m
    [1mBug: Regex[0m
        too many false positives (user, last, least, ...).

    [1mBug: Regex[0m
        Strings in text could be used with " or '.

    [1mBug: Reports [0m
        Reports number of analyzed LOC is wrong (=0) for svn access.

    [1mLimitation: Tag[0m
        Tagfiles cannot be used with a SVN repo yet.

    [1mLimitation: extensions[0m
        Only one extension can be specified at a time.

    [1mLimitation: tests[0m
        Testing (non regression, functionnal, ...) is not included in the
        estimation and can change rather drastically the cost in man-days.
